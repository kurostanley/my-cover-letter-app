      "cvReference": "Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to express my interest in the Backend engineer position at Deezer. As a former music company manger and an huge music enthusiast, I am excited to see that Deezer is using technology to uncover new possibilities for fans and artists. I understand the challenges of the music industry better than anyone and I am eager to solve these problems through software. This is an opportunity for me to put my expertise and passion into the work, and I hope to become a part of the development team to grow and work together to create a software that helps music professionals and audiences all over the world. I would like to briefly share my personal project, Beatmatcher, which showcases both my skills and passion in music and software development. With thousands of music and beats being released every day, I pondered how to match beatmakers with songwriters in the fastest way possible. Thus, I developed the Beatmatcher software that allows musicians to judge their preferences through a 30-second music clip and match each other through mutual admiration, leading to future collaborations. I built the backend program using node.js and MySQL and used websocket for real-time notifications and messaging technology, and AWS to cloud the service. Through this project, I have developed my ability to quickly learn new technologies and create innovative ideas, and I am confident that I will continue to make a positive impact on the music industry in the future. https://github.com/kurostanley/BeatMatcher Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to move onto the next stage and showcase my skills and enthusiasm for software development."

      "cvReference": "Hi Alex Proudfoot, I hope this email finds you well. I came across the job opening at JuiceBox Store and am writing to express my interest in the position. My journey in the realm of taste commenced with specialty coffee and has since evolved, leading me to my current role at a craft beer bar. Delving into diverse culinary experiences, I've gained insights into the nuances of flavor, production processes, and beverage cultures. Sharing this knowledge with others brings me great joy. Over the past year, I've also delved into the world of natural wines, with a particular fascination for experimental winemaking methods. I am enthusiastic about bringing this passion to JuiceBox and sharing it with customers while growing alongside my colleagues. I am a team player who thrives in fostering a positive work atmosphere. Continuously honing my skills, I dedicate my off-hours to supplementing any knowledge gaps and seek guidance from colleagues when needed. I also enjoy exploring different bars to expand my understanding of diverse beverage cultures and service approaches. I am planning to relocate to Manchester in January and am eager to join the JuiceBox team. I hope to have the opportunity for a further interview to provide you with a more in-depth understanding of my qualifications. Best regards, Lin"
